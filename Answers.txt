a) Dependency injection in UserService constructor as it receives the IF instread of calling new to initialize  it.
b) Observer design pattern can be used to implement the requirment where a manager should be notified when a user registers in his department.

Role tabel  (PK roleId)
user-Role tabel (many to many relashionship between users and roles) will contains both userId and roleId
